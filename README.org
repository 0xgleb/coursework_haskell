* Purpose

The purpose of this project is to investigate how Haskell works and how its features benefit the developers. This investigation will show why Haskell as a high level language is better than standard imperative languages in terms of safety, expressiveness, high-level abstractions, modularity and performance. A lot of the concepts that Haskell uses can be found in other functional programming languages and even in some imperative languages. Over the course of this project I will demonstrate how Haskell works, explain its concepts, and compare that to more commonly used languages and concepts.

* Analysis

When we pick a programming language for a project we want it to have several features that will make the process of building the project faster and easier. In this investigation project I will identify the most important features that a general purpose high-level programming language should have and show how Haskell implements them. First, let's identify the main features that make high-level programming languages different from the low-level ones.

** Goal
*** Safety

Usually programmers spend a lot of time finding and fixing bugs, which is a huge problem because for businesses it's crucial to deliver code as fast as possible. But what's an even bigger problem is programs crashing in production. This can cause businesses to lose a lot money or, in the worst cases, shut down. So we want programming languages to prevent as many bugs as possible.

A lot of run-time issues happen because of state changes. In most languages variables are mutable and functions can have side effects, this means that we can accidentally change a global variable and cause the entire program to crash.

Here are some examples of methods that we can use to solve this problem: type systems, automated tests, code checkers. Let's take a look at every one of these approaches. Not all languages have type systems, but even the ones that do usually allow dangerous actions like implicit casting. Automated tests are great and they help a lot, but it's hard to test every single thing, especially if the part of the code that you are testing depends on the state. Non-standard code checkers can help, but often they can't prevent even simple run-time errors.

*** Expressiveness

We want to write the least amount of code possible. At the same time we want the code to be readable and elegant. As I mentioned above the development speed is very important and it reduces if we can quickly express ideas without writing too much code.

To solve this problem most languages just create special syntax for common things, for example instead of just having while loops they also support for loops. This can help, but this approach has two problems: it clutters up the language and it doesn't solve the problem generally, this approach only adds hacks for common specific things.

*** High level abstractions

High-level languages allow developers to think just about solving the business problem and minimize the amount of the code that specifies what exactly happens inside the computer. There are two areas that are fundamental in programming - resource management and sequencing. Most modern languages have tools like garbage collectors that automatically deal with resource management, however, as most languages are imperative, they force the programmer to specify the order of computations. This is because the main idea of imperative programming is to allow programmers to write a sequence of instructions that computer will execute. The only thing imperative languages can do to abstract sequencing is introducing new keywords and libraries, thus cluttering the language.

We also want to be able to work with complex abstractions and general versions of different types. For example if the only important aspect of a data structure is that it can be parsed from a string then we don't want to work with a specific type, we want to use the most general case possible. Also this helps avoiding errors.

*** Modularity

We want to reuse as much code as possible. We also should be able to easily compose different parts of a program together. This is one of the main concepts of programming.

*** Performance

Depending on what we are developing we have different performance requirements, so we want programming languages to help us make efficient programs. Of course using a high-level language for writing low-level applications like drivers is usually a bad idea, but high-level languages should work as fast as possible without loosing benefits of high-level languages.

** How Haskell works
*** Hello World and more.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
main :: IO ()
main = print "Hello World!"
#+END_SRC

Now let's write a console program that asks user to input their name and then prints "Hello <username>!"
Haskell's IO parts of the program can look very similar to "normal" programming languages.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
    print "What's your name?"
    name <- getLine
    print ("Hello " ++ name ++ "!")
#+END_SRC

But we can write this in functional style.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
main :: IO ()
main = print "What's your name?" >> getLine >>= print . (++ "!") . ("Hello " ++)
#+END_SRC

We will come back to both of these examples later.

*** Function purity

Haskell is very different from most languages. In Haskell all variables are immutable. This means that you don't really have variables, you only have constants. Also in Haskell all functions are pure. A pure function a function that any time it gets called with the same arguments returns the same result. Pure functions don't have side effects; they can't print something to console, read files or modify variables. Functions in Haskell are like functions in maths, they are just mappings between types. These properties make testing and debugging code much easier.

*** Lazy evaluation

Another aspect that makes Haskell very different from an average programming language is the fact that by default it uses lazy evaluation. This means that functions won't get evaluated until the result is needed. When a program gets executed it won't do unnecessary computations.

*** Defining functions

Let's define a function ~f~ that squares a number in both Python and Haskell. Here is how it would look like in Python:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def f(x, y):
    return x*x + y*y
#+END_SRC

And here is the Haskell version:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
f x y = x*x + y*y
#+END_SRC

In Haskell to pass arguments into a function we don't use brackets and/or commas, we separate arguments with spaces. As you can see the definition is very simple and it doesn't use any unnecessary syntax like ~def~ or ~return~. It's just the function name, arguments and what it returns.

In Haskell functions and types are the two primary things and everything is centered around them, so it makes sense why it's very easy to define them.

*** Introduction to the type system

In Haskell you don't need to explicitly declare types of functions or variables, the compiler will derive them for you. However, explicitly declaring types of functions and variables is a good practice. Let's declare the type of the previous function and then write a main function to test ~f~.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
f :: Int -> Int -> Int
f x y = x*x + y*y

main = print (f 2 3)
#+END_SRC

But what if we want function ~f~ to work with all numbers and not just integers. The first solution is to remove the type declaration, in that case our file would look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
f x y = x*x + y*y

main = print (f 2.1 4)
#+END_SRC

GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) is the default Haskell compiler. Haskell can be both compiled and interpreted, which is why there is an interactive environment - GHCi, which you can use to run Haskell code without making a file for it. It can also tell us the type of any defined function. Let's use it to find the type of ~f~.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
Prelude> :load sum_squares.hs 
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( sum_squares.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Main.
**Main> :t f
f :: Num a => a -> a -> a
**Main> 
#+END_SRC

OK, let's figure out what that type is.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :align |l|l|
|--------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Type         | Value                                                                            |
|--------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /            | <>                                                                               |
| Int          | An integer                                                                       |
| Int -> Int   | A function that takes an integer and returns an integer                          |
| Float -> Int | A function that takes a float and returns an integer                             |
| a -> Int     | A function that takes a value of any type and returns an integer                 |
| a -> a       | A function that takes a value of any type and returns something of the same type |
|--------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

In Haskell type ~a -> a -> a~ is the same as ~a -> (a -> a)~. This means that this is a function that takes an argument of any type and returns a function that takes an argument of the same type and returns something of the same type, so basically it's a function with two arguments. The benefit of this representation is that we can give the function only one argument and get a valid expression which is a function. This is called partial application.

When in a type declaration you see something starting with a small letter, it means that it's a type variable. Type variables give us parametric polymorphism. Also, for example, if you have a function that takes two arguments of any type, but both arguments have the same type, you can specify that using type variables.

But our function type is not just ~a -> a -> a~, it also has prefix ~Num a =>~. This means that ~a~ is in the type class ~Num~. Type classes are like interfaces in OOP languages. They declare a list of signatures of variables, functions, and types. A type is in a type class if it implements all the members of the type class.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
class Num a where
    (+) :: a -> a -> a
    (-) :: a -> a -> a
    (*) :: a -> a -> a
    negate :: a -> a
    abs :: a -> a
    signum :: a -> a
    fromInteger :: Integer -> a
#+END_SRC

Here is the definition of the type class ~Num~. In Haskell operators are just normal functions. By writing ~Num a =>~ we restrict all possible types to only allow the ones that implement the functions listed above.

So the type ~Num a => a -> a -> a~ means that it's a function that takes a number and returns a function that takes another number of the same type and then returns a number of the same type. Technically all functions in Haskell take only one argument. But any function that takes two arguments can be represented as a function that takes one argument and returns a function. So the expression ~f 3 4~ is equivalent to ~(f 3) 4~ and ~f 3~ is a function.

To define functions we can use another notation - lambda functions.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
f = \x y -> x*x + y*y
#+END_SRC

*** Basic minimum of Haskell

I will use ~<=>~ to show that two expressions are equivalent. This is not a part of the Haskell syntax.

**** Arithmetic operations

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
3 + 2 * 6 / 3 <=> 3 + ((2 * 6) / 3)
#+END_SRC

**** Logic

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
True || False <=> True
True && False <=> False
True == False <=> False
True /= False <=> True
#+END_SRC

**** Powers

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
x ^ n  -- for non-negative integer powers
x ** y -- for floating numbers
#+END_SRC

**** Lists

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
[] -- empty list
[1, 2, 3] -- a list of numbers
["foo", "bar"] -- a list of strings
1:[2, 3] <=> [1, 2, 3] -- (:) prepends an element to a list
1:2:[] <=> [1, 2]
[1,2] ++ [3,4] <=> [1, 2, 3, 4] -- (++) joins two lists
[1,2] ++ ["?"] -- compilation error
[1..4] <=> [1, 2, 3, 4]
[1,3..10] <=> [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
[2,3,5,7..100] -- error, the compiler is not that smart
[5,4..1] <=> [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
#+END_SRC

**** Strings

In Haskell strings are just lists of chars.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
'a' :: Char
"a" :: [Char] -- :: String
"ab" -- ['a', 'b']
#+END_SRC

This is not very efficient, which is why in most cases people use other data types that represent strings.

**** Tuples

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
-- All of these tuples are valid
(2,"foo")
(3,'a',[2,3])
((2,"a"),"c",3)

fst (x, y) = x
snd (x, y) = y

fst (x, y, z) -- ERROR: fst :: (a, b) -> a
snd (x, y, z) -- ERROR: snd :: (a, b) -> b
#+END_SRC

*** Applying functions

Here are two operators that are used very often.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
(.) f g x = f (g x)

($) :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
($) f x = f x
#+END_SRC

Here are some examples:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
f g h x <=> (((f g) h) x)

f g $ h x   <=> f g (h x)
f $ g h x   <=> f (g h x) <=> f ((g h) x)
f $ g $ h x <=> f (g (h x))

(f . g) x     <=> f . g $ x     <=> f (g x)
(f . g . h) x <=> f . g . h $ x <=> f (g (h x))
#+END_SRC

*** More on the syntax

**** Infix and prefix notation

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
square :: Num a => a -> a
square x = x ^ 2
#+END_SRC

Any infix operator can be used in prefix notation.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
square' x = (^) x 2
square'' x = (^2) x
#+END_SRC

We can remove ~x~ from the right hand side, this is called \eta-reduction.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
square''' = (^2)
#+END_SRC

All these functions are identical.

And functions in Haskell can be used in infix notation as well.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
add :: Num a => a -> a -> a
add = (+)

5 `add` 4 <=> add 5 4 <=> 9
#+END_SRC

**** Conditions

Type class ~Ord~ is for types that can be ordered.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
absolute :: (Ord a, Num a) => a -> a
absolute x = if x >= 0 then x else -x
#+END_SRC

In Haskell if statements must always have ~then~ and ~else~.

Here is another way to write that function:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
absolute' x
  | x >= 0 = x
  | otherwise = -x
#+END_SRC

In Haskell indentation is very important. Just like in Python programs with incorrect indentation will not work or, in some cases, will work, but not the way it was intended. Haskell uses spaces instead of tabs, if you try to use tabs then the program won't compile.

*** Functional style

Let's introduce a problem and then solve it using first Python and then Haskell.

We want a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers in that list.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> 2 + 4 -> 6
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def evenSum(l):
    result = 0
    for x in l:
        if(x % 2 == 0):
            result += x
    return result  
#+END_SRC

We can't implement it in Haskell exactly the same way because it doesn't have loops or mutable variables. So here is how we can implement it in Python without mutating variables or using loops.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def accumSum(l, n):
    if(len(l) == 0):
        return n
    else:
        x, *xs = l
        if(x % 2 == 0):
            return accumSum(xs, x + n)
        else:
            return accumSum(xs, n)

def evenSum(l):
    return accumSum(l, 0)
#+END_SRC

Before we start, here are some Haskell functions we will use.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
even :: Integral a => a -> Bool -- returns True only if the given number is even
head :: [a] -> a                -- returns the first element of the given list
tail :: [a] -> [a]              -- returns the given list without the first element
#+END_SRC

Here is our first solution:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
evenSum :: [Integer] -> Integer
evenSum l = accumSum 0 l

accumSum :: Integer -> [Integer] -> Integer
accumSum n l = if l == []
                  then n
                  else let x  = head l
                           xs = tail l
                           in if even x
                                 then accumSum (n+x) xs
                                 else accumSum n xs
#+END_SRC

We can do several improvements to this piece of code. First we can make the type declaration more general (without changing the implementation).

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
evenSum :: Integral a => [a] -> a
#+END_SRC

We don't want ~accumSum~ to be a global variable, so we can make it local using ~where~ clause. Also we can use pattern matching instead of ~head~ and ~tail~. Then we can use \eta-reduction to get this:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
evenSum :: Integral a => [a] -> a
evenSum = accumSum 0
    where accumSum n []     = n
          accumSum n (x:xs) = if even x
                                 then accumSum (n+x) xs
                                 else accumSum x xs
#+END_SRC

Pattern matching is using values instead of variable arguments. We can't use any function we want on the left side - only type constructors, which I will discuss later.

We can simplify this even more using higher order functions.

*** Higher order functions

Higher order functions are functions that take another function as an argument. Here are several examples:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
map    :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
foldl  :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
(.)    :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
($)    :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
#+END_SRC

Function ~filter~ takes a function of type ~a -> Bool~ and a list ~[a]~. It returns a list that only contains the elements of the given list that return ~True~ when the given function is applied.

~map~ takes a function and a list and applies the function to every element of the list.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
filter even [1..5] <=> [2, 4]

map (*2) [1..5] <=> [2,4,6,8,10]
#+END_SRC

Let's use this.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
evenSum l = mysum $ filter even l
    where mysum n []     = 0
          mysum n (x:xs) = mysum (n+x) xs
#+END_SRC

Now, what is ~foldl~?

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
foldl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
foldl op prev []     = prev
foldl op prev (x:xs) = foldl op (prev `op` x) xs
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
foldl f z [x1,x2,x3,x4] <=> f (f (f (f z x1) x2) x3) x4
#+END_SRC

So let's use it for our problem.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
evenSum :: Integral a => [a] -> a
evenSum = foldl (+) 0 . filter even
#+END_SRC

*** Defining your own types

**** type

~type TypeName = AnotherType~ just makes a type synonym of ~String~.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
type Name = String
#+END_SRC

~Name~ and ~String~ are the same type. This is useful for making type declarations more meaningful.

**** data

~data NewDataType = TypeConstructor AnotherType~ is how we make a new simple type. This code makes a type constructor which is a special function that allows us to create instances of the ~NewDataType~. We don't need to write an implementation for this function, we get it by defining the type.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
TypeConstructor :: AnotherType -> NewDataType
#+END_SRC

Now ~AnotherType~ and ~NewDataType~ are two different types even though they represent the same data. This means that if we have a function that takes an argument of type ~AnotherType~ then it won't compile if we pass it something of type ~NewDataType~. To extract data we can use pattern matching on type constructors.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
toOriginalType :: NewDataType -> AnotherType
toOriginalType (TypeConstructor thing) = thing
#+END_SRC

Constructors can have multiple arguments or none at all. We can use the name of the type as the constructor name, which is what people usually do when there is only one constructor.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data Thing = Thing

data StringPair = StringPair String String
#+END_SRC

We can have types with multiple constructors.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data MaybeString = JustString String | NoString
#+END_SRC

This code creates a new type ~MaybeString~ with two constructors: ~JustString~ and ~NoString~. We can do pattern matching on both of the constructors.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
hasString :: MaybeString -> Bool
hasString (JustString _) = True
hasString NoString       = False
#+END_SRC

In pattern matching we can replace a variable with an underscore if we don't use that variable.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data Person = Person String Int

name :: Person -> String
name (Person str _) = str

age :: Person -> String
age (Person _ n) = n
#+END_SRC

Instead of writing functions ~name~ and ~age~ we can use fields and the compiler will generate them.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data Person = Person { name :: String
                     , age  :: Int
                     }
#+END_SRC

This gives us the same ~name~ and ~age~ functions.

*** Recursive types

**** Lists

List is a common example of a recursive type. Here is how we can define the list type:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data List a = Empty | Cons a (List a)
#+END_SRC

Type ~List~ takes another type as an argument. We can see two constructors, here are their types:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
Empty :: List a
Cons  :: a -> List a -> List a
#+END_SRC

Haskell allows the use of special characters in names, this gives us the definition of lists from the standard library:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data [] a = [] | a : [a]
#+END_SRC

If we tried to print our new list it wouldn't work, because we don't have a function for conversion to string defined for it. Haskell has function ~show :: Show a => a -> String~ which is defined in the type class ~Show~. So we can make our ~List~ an instance of ~Show~. However, for predefined type classes, we can use a simpler approach. We can just derive that instance.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data List a = Empty | Cons a (List a)
     deriving (Show)
#+END_SRC

We can also derive type class instances for ~Read~ (parsing strings), ~Eq~ (checking for equality), ~Ord~ (ordering), etc. This way we can get a lot of functions for free.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data List a = Empty | Cons a (List a)
     deriving (Show, Read, Eq, Ord)
#+END_SRC

**** Trees

Here is another example of a recursive data type - binary trees.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data BinTree a = Empty
               | Node a (BinTree a) (BinTree a)
               deriving (Show)
#+END_SRC

Because we used an arbitrary type variable ~a~ in the type declaration we can make a lot of different trees. For example we can make trees of trees.

*** Infinite structures

Haskell uses lazy evaluation, which is why we can have infinite data structures. For example in Haskell we can do this:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
numbers :: [Integer]
numbers = 1 : map (+1) numbers

main = print $ take 3 numbers
#+END_SRC

The function ~take~ takes the first ~n~ numbers from the given list. If we run this code it won't get stuck in an infinite recursion, it will print ~[1,2,3]~. Because of lazy evaluation Haskell doesn't calculate all the numbers in the list, but only the ones that it needs.

In this example we just have all positive integers. Let's take a look at a more interesting example with a tree.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
tree :: BinTree Integer
tree = Node 0 (dec tree) (inc tree)
    where dec (Node x l r) = Node (x-1) (dec l) (dec r)
          inc (Node x l r) = Node (x+1) (inc l) (inc r)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
        |(-2)..
  |(-1)-|
  |     |( 0)..
0-|
  |     |( 0)..
  |( 1)-|
        |( 2)..
#+END_SRC

# **** TODO add a nice diagram of the tree

# (Reference: Learn Haskell Fast and Hard) ((I'll do all the references later))

*** Functors

Functor is one of the most important abstractions in Haskell. Basically, it is a type class that generalizes the ~map~ function.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
class Functor f where
    fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
#+END_SRC

The notion of functors comes from maths, and in maths there are laws for it. Unfortunately GHC doesn't support laws in type classes, so it's programmers' responsibility to make sure they work. The only relevant to Haskell law is that if we have two functions: ~h :: a -> b~ and ~f :: b -> c~ then for any functor ~fmap (f . h)~ should be the same as ~fmap f . fmap h~. ~<$>~ is a infix operator for ~fmap~.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
f <$> x = fmap f x
#+END_SRC

Here are some examples of functors:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing

instance Functor Maybe where
    fmap f (Just x) = Just $ f x
    fmap _ Nothing  = Nothing

maybeFive :: Maybe Int
maybeFive = Just 5

maybeSix :: Maybe Int
maybeSix = fmap (+1) maybeFive -- = Just 6

data [] a = [] | a : [a]

instance Functor [] where
    fmap f (x:xs) = f x : fmap f xs
    fmap _ []     = []
    -- fmap = map

data Either a b = Left a | Right b

    fmap f (Right x) = Right $ f x
    fmap _ (Left x)  = Left x

numberOrString = Right "World"

numberOrHello = ("Hello " ++) <$> numberOrString -- Right "Hello World"

#+END_SRC

*** Applicative functors

As you know ~Maybe~ is a functor. This is why we can do this:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
Prelude> negate <$> Just 2
Just (-2)
#+END_SRC

But what if we want to add two ~Maybe~ numbers.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
Prelude> :t (+) <$> Just 2
(+) <$> Just 2 :: Num a => Maybe (a -> a)
#+END_SRC

After we partially apply addition using ~fmap~ we get a function inside a functor. How to apply that function to our second ~Maybe~ number? Use applicative functors.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
class Functor f => Applicative f where
    pure :: a -> f a
    <*>  :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
#+END_SRC

~Maybe~ is an applicative functor, hence we can do this:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
Prelude> (+) <$> Just 2 <*> Just 3
Just 5
#+END_SRC

Applicative functors also have laws:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
pure id  <*> v             <=> v                -- identity
pure f   <*> pure x        <=> pure (f x)       -- homomorphism
u        <*> pure y        <=> pure ($ y) <*> u -- interchange
pure (.) <*> u <*> b <*> w <=> u <*> (v <*> w)  -- composition
#+END_SRC

Here are some examples of applicative functors:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing

instance Applicative Maybe where
    pure = Just
    (Just f) <*> (Just x) = Just $ f x
    _        <*> _        = Nothing

data [] a = [] | a : [a]

instance Applicative [] where
    pure x = [x]
    _      <*> [] = []
    []     <*> _  = []
    (f:fs) <*> l  = (f <$> l) ++ (fs <*> l)
    -- applied every function to every element of the list

data Reader r a = Reader { runReader :: r -> a }

instance Applicative (Reader r) where
    pure g = Reader $ const g -- const :: a -> b -> a
    f <*> g = Reader $ \r -> runReader f r $ runReader g r
#+END_SRC

*** Monads

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
headMay :: [a] -> Maybe a
headMay []    = Nothing
headMay (x:_) = Just x
#+END_SRC

Assume we have a list of lists and we want to safely get the first element of the first list. We can't use ~head~ as it will crash if you call it with an empty list, so we need to apply ~headMay~ twice. We can try using ~fmap headMay . headMay~, but then we'll get this:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
Prelude> :t fmap headMay . headMay
fmap headMay . headMay :: [[a]] -> Maybe (Maybe a)
#+END_SRC

We want to reduce ~Maybe (Maybe a)~ to just ~Maybe a~.
Another example is if we want to convert a list of lists into a single list.
Both of these problems can be solved using monads. Here are some definitions:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
const :: a -> b -> a
const x _ = x

class Applicative m => Monad m where
    (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
    (>>) :: m a -> m b -> m b
    x >> y = x >>= const y -- default implementation

instance Monad Maybe where
    (Just x) >>= f = f x
    Nothing  >>= _ = Nothing

instance Monad [] where
    (x:xs) >>= f = f x ++ (xs >>= f)
    []     >>= _ = []
#+END_SRC

Now for the first problem we can do this: 

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
headMay l >>= headMay
#+END_SRC

~l~ is the list of lists. And here is how we can solve the second problem:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
Prelude> :t (>>= id)
(>>= id) :: Monad m => m (m b) -> m b
Prelude> [[1..5],[6..10]] >>= id
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
#+END_SRC

If we import ~Control.Monad~ we'll get several helper functions for working with monads.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
join :: m (m a) -> m a
join = (>>= id)

(>=>) :: (a -> m b) -> (b -> m c) -> (a -> m c)
(>=>) f h = \x -> f x >>= h
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
Prelude> headMay l = if length l == 0 then Nothing else Just $ head l
Prelude> import Control.Monad
Prelude Control.Monad> :t join
join :: Monad m => m (m a) -> m a
Prelude Control.Monad> join [[1..5],[6..10]]
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
Prelude Control.Monad> :t headMay >=> headMay
headMay >=> headMay :: [[c]] -> Maybe c
#+END_SRC

*** IO

In Haskell functions are pure, however printing to console, reading/writing files, and other IO actions don't give the same results every time you call them. To deal with IO actions Haskell has a special monad - IO monad. This allows us to isolate pure and impure parts of the code. In our program we have ~main~ procedure which has type ~IO ()~.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data () = ()
#+END_SRC

**** Printing to console

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
putStr :: String -> IO ()   -- prints the given string 
putStrLn :: String -> IO () -- prints the given string and starts a new line
print :: Show a => a -> IO ()
print = putStrLn . show
#+END_SRC

Now we can write a "Hello World" program.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
main :: IO ()
main = print "Hello World!"
#+END_SRC

**** Reading user console input

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
getChar :: IO Char
getLine :: IO String
#+END_SRC

Notice that these are not functions, they are IO actions. Now we can write a program that asks for the user's name and prints "Hello <username>!".

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
main :: IO ()
main = print "What's your name?" >> getLine >>= print . ("Hello " ++) . (++ "!")
#+END_SRC

**** Do notation

We can use a simpler notation for monads that is more similar to imperative programming languages.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do print "What's your name?"
    name <- getLine
    print $ "Hello " ++ name ++ "!"
#+END_SRC

In this case every line must be an IO action. This syntax is a nicer way of writing this:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
main :: IO ()
main = print "What's your name?"
    >> getLine
   >>= \name -> print ("Hello " ++ name ++ "!")
#+END_SRC

For the compiler these two things are identical. We can use do notation not only with the IO monad, but with any monad.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
headMay :: [a] -> Maybe a
headMay (x:xs) = Just x
headMay []     = Nothing

headOfHead :: [[a]] -> Maybe a
headOfHead l = do h <- headMay l
                  headMay h
#+END_SRC

** Spec for the examples

To show that Haskell is better than other high-level programming languages I will solve several problems in Haskell and Ruby. Ruby is a high-level programming language, and it is almost the exact opposite of Haskell: it's imperative (although it supports some features from functional programming, as Haskell is one of the languages that Ruby was inspired by, I will avoid using them to show more differences between imperative and functional programming), dynamically typed, interpreted, and object oriented.

*** Example 1: sorting a big file

In this example I will write a script that reads numbers from a file, sorts them, and writes the sorted list to another file. Even though this investigation is about high-level languages, I decided to include a solution to this problem in a low-level language C. I did this to make a more representative performance comparison. In order to show this I will measure time taken for each of the scripts to process a file with one million random integers.

*** Example 2: reverse polish server

In this example I will implement a client-server system. The client takes an expression in reverse polish notation and an action (check or evaluate), then the expression gets sent to the server where the required action gets executed, finally the client shows the result of performing the given action on the given expression.

By comparing methods for defining and implementing an API this example is to show Haskell's safety, expressiveness, high-level abstractions, and modularity.

* Sorting a big file
** Design
*** Algorithm

<<sec:design_sorting>>

The script needs to read the file \texttt{"random\_numbers"}, which contains comma-separated integers, parse the contents to get the list of integers, sort them, convert back to the original format, and write the result to the file ="{language}_result"= (where ={language}= is the name of the language that was used for the script).

[[./img/file_sorting_diagram.png]]

*** Tests

For testing the scripts I will write another script that generates a comma-separated list of integers in range $[1,1000]$.
# | / | <17>              | <35>                                | <40>                                     |

*** Benchmark

Generate a file with 1 million random integers, find how much time each script takes to execute.

** Solution
*** Code
**** Haskell

#+NAME: code:haskell_sort
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as C
import           Data.List                  (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = C.readFile "random_numbers"
   >>= maybe (print "Failed to parse!")
             ( C.writeFile "haskell_result"
             . C.intercalate "," . fmap (C.pack . show) . sort . fmap fst
             ) . traverse C.readInt . C.split ','
#+END_SRC

The first line enables a language extension called ~OverloadedStrings~. It allows us to use different types as strings. For example, in this script \texttt{"random\_numbers"} is a standard string and "," is a byte string. The compiler can infer the right type of string from type definitions - the first argument of ~C.readFile~ is of type ~String~ and the first argument of ~C.intercalate~ is ~ByteString~.

Then I imported two modules. The first one is from a library called ~bytestring~. The default Haskell strings are very inefficient as they are just lists of characters, but there are different alternatives. One of them is using byte strings, which are arrays of bytes. There are two kinds of byte strings: strict and lazy. In this case I used a special version of lazy byte strings that interprets each byte as a character. The keyword ~qualified~ in the import statement means that the contents of the module won't be in the global namespace. ~as C~ means that we refer to the module as ~C~. For example, we can write ~C.pack~ instead of ~Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8.pack~.

Secondly I imported sort function from the ~Data.List~ module. It's an implementation of the merge sort algorithm. One of classical examples of Haskell code, that shows how nice and expressive it is, is the Quicksort function.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
qsort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
qsort (x:xs) = qsort (filter (< x) xs) ++ [x] ++ qsort (filter (>= x) xs)
qsort []     = []
#+END_SRC

At first glance it looks similar to the quicksort algorithm, but it's actually less efficient. It uses the same idea - divide and conquer, however the performance of the original quicksort function relies on the very fast swap mechanism, which is not something we can easily do in Haskell. As Haskell uses immutable data structures it doesn't swap any values in memory, it creates new ones. This is why merge sort is usually more efficient than quicksort in Haskell.

In ~main~ I have a composition of many different functions. Let's quickly take a look at every one of them.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
C.readFile :: FilePath -> IO C.ByteString
#+END_SRC

~FilePath~ is a type synonym for ~String~. ~C.readFile~ takes a file path and returns the contents of the file as a byte string.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
C.split :: Char -> C.ByteString -> [C.ByteString]
#+END_SRC

This function breaks a byte string into pieces separated by the first argument, consuming the delimiter.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
C.readInt :: C.ByteString -> Maybe (Int, C.ByteString)
#+END_SRC

~C.readInt~ reads an ~Int~ from the beginning of the given byte string. If it fails to do that then it returns ~Nothing~, otherwise it returns the integer and the rest of the string.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
class Foldable t where
  foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> t a -> b

class (Functor t, Foldable t) => Traversable t where
  traverse :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)
#+END_SRC

# (Reference [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.1.0/docs/Data-Traversable.html]])

~traverse~ maps each element of a structure to an action, evaluates these actions from left to right, and collects the result.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
traverse C.readInt :: Traversable t => t C.ByteString -> Maybe (t (Int, C.ByteString))
#+END_SRC

List is in the ~Traversable~ type class, which is why we can compose this with ~C.split ','~.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
traverse C.readInt . C.split ',' :: C.ByteString -> Maybe [(Int, C.ByteString)]
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
maybe :: b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b
#+END_SRC

The type fully explains what the function does.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
C.pack :: [Char] -> C.ByteString
#+END_SRC

~C.pack~ takes a string and converts it into a byte string.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
C.intercalate :: C.ByteString -> [C.ByteString] -> C.ByteString
#+END_SRC

~C.intercalate~ joins a list of byte strings, putting the first argument between each element of the list.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
fmap fst :: Functor f => f (b1, b2) -> f b1

sort . fmap fst :: Ord a => [(a, b)] -> [a]

C.pack . show :: Show a => a -> C.ByteString

fmap (C.pack . show) . sort . fmap fst :: (Ord a, Show a) => [(a, b)] -> [C.ByteString]

C.intercalate "," . fmap (C.pack . show) . sort . fmap fst
  :: (Ord a, Show a) => [(a, b)] -> C.ByteString
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
C.writeFile :: FilePath -> C.ByteString -> IO ()
#+END_SRC

~C.writeFile~ takes a file path and a byte string and writes the byte string to the file, overwriting existing data or creating the file if it doesn't exist.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
C.readFile "random_numbers" :: IO C.ByteString

maybe (print "Failed to parse!")
      ( C.writeFile "haskell_result"
      . C.intercalate "," . fmap (C.pack . show) . sort . fmap fst
      ) . traverse C.readInt . C.split ','
      :: C.ByteString -> IO ()

(>>=) :: Monad m => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
#+END_SRC

If we put all these things together we'll get ~main~. In summary, it reads numbers from \texttt{"random\_numbers"}, splits the string with comma separated integers into a list of byte strings with integers, then parses each integer, prints "Failed to parse!" in case it fails to parse, otherwise sorts the list of integers, converts each integer back into a byte string, joins the byte strings and writes the result to \texttt{"haskell\_result"}.

#+END_SRC

*** Tests

I wrote a script that generates a list of random numbers in range $[1,1000]$ and writes them to a file separated by commas to test the sorting script.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
import Control.Monad
import System.Random

numOfNums :: Integer
numOfNums = 10

file :: FilePath
file = "random_numbers"

main :: IO ()
main =  join
     $  (\(r:rs) -> foldl (\p x -> p >> addToFile (',' : show x)) (writeFile file $ show r) rs)
    <$> foldl (\rs _ -> (:) <$> (randomRIO (1, 1000) :: IO Int) <*> rs) (return []) [1..numOfNums]
     where addToFile = appendFile file
#+END_SRC

I changed ~SIZE~ macro in the C script to ~10~ for the purpose of the test.

[[./img/sort_test.png]]

I used some Linux commands to run the test. =cat= takes a file name and shows the file (if it exists). The scripts I wrote don't add a newline character at the end of files. To get a newline after the output of =cat=, I used =echo= command. It takes a string and prints it, I didn't give it any input, so it just print a newline. =diff= command shows differences between 2 files.

First I ran the first test to check that the number generating script works correctly. As you can see, it does. Then I ran all 3 sorting scripts, and did the second test on the output of the script written in Haskell. =haskell_result= contains the sorted list, so the test is passed. Then I ran test 3 and compared the 3 output files. =diff= command didn't show any differences, hence all the scripts work correctly.

*** Benchmark

I generated a file with one million random numbers (I changed macro ~SIZE~ in the C script back to a million) and measured the execution time using =time= command and tested that the output is correct by doing test 3 again.

[[./img/sort_performance.png]]

** Evaluation
**** Safety

Let's take a look at the function ~C.readInt~. It returns ~Maybe (Int, C.ByteString)~. In most languages you can work with nullable types without checking if they are actually null, but Haskell doesn't allow that. It forces you to do something with the fact that a value can be ~Nothing~. In this case I covered the case when it's ~Nothing~ by using the function ~maybe~ and providing the default behavior for that situation. If you want you can unsafely cast ~Maybe a~ to ~a~ using the function ~fromJust~ from the ~Data.Maybe~ module. However, the compiler won't make that decision for you and you'll have to explicitly tell it to do so. This shows how Haskell is a safer language.

**** Expressiveness

As you can see we didn't need a lot of code to solve the problem. If you take a look at the way the algorithm was described in English in [[sec:design_sorting]] you'll see that the code I wrote does exactly that. We basically tell Haskell what we want to achieve and not how to achieve it.

             . C.intercalate "," . fmap (C.pack . show) -- convert back to the original format
             . sort -- sort them
             . fmap fst ) . traverse C.readInt . C.split ',' -- parse comma-separated integers
#+END_SRC

In the Ruby solution, as you can see in the source code, the code represents a sequence of instructions which the computer needs to do. The Haskell version of the program has less code in it (even if we remove the comments) and the structure of the Haskell script is closer to the way the problem was defined in English, which shows us the expressiveness of the language.

**** Modularity

This script also shows how modular Haskell is. To solve the problem I just glue together 13 different functions using 2 operators. If we want to reuse some of the functionality we can easily extract the piece of code that does what we want from ~main~ and put it in another function. For example, let's say we want to reuse the code for parsing.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as C
import           Data.List                  (sort)

parse :: C.ByteString -> Maybe [Int]
parse = fmap (fmap fst) . traverse C.readInt . C.split ','

main :: IO ()
main = C.readFile "random_numbers"
   >>= maybe (print "Failed to parse!")
             ( C.writeFile "haskell_result"
             . C.intercalate "," . fmap (C.pack . show) . sort
             ) . parse
#+END_SRC

As you can see, in Haskell it's very easy to compose and decompose code.

**** Performance

As you can see in the benchmark results, Haskell didn't perform very well in this test. Why is that? I used ~sort~ function that applies mergesort algorithm on immutable lists. This is a problem for performance for several reasons: mergesort is not very fast, lists are not very fast, we need to allocate memory very often.

I solved this problem by replacing the sort function. I used unboxed vectors (using ~vector~ library), safe (internal) mutations, and introspective sorting (using ~vector-algorithms~ library).

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8   as C
import qualified Data.Vector.Algorithms.Intro as Alg
import qualified Data.Vector.Unboxed          as U

sort :: (Ord a, U.Unbox a) => [a] -> [a]
sort = U.toList . U.modify Alg.sort . U.fromList

main :: IO ()
main = C.readFile "random_numbers"
   >>= maybe (print "Failed to parse!")
             ( C.writeFile "haskell_result"
             . C.intercalate "," . fmap (C.pack . show) . sort . fmap fst
             ) . traverse C.readInt . C.split ','
#+END_SRC

***** Unboxed vectors

~vector~ library provides efficient arrays. Unboxed types are raw values. So boxed (default) vectors are arrays of pointers and unboxed vectors are arrays of raw values.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
U.fromList :: U.Unbox a => [a] -> U.Vector a
U.toList :: U.Unbox a => U.Vector a -> [a]
#+END_SRC

As you can guess from the names and types ~U.fromList~ converts a list of values that can be represented as raw values to an unboxed vector and ~U.toList~ converts an unboxed vector to a list.

***** Introsort

Introspective sorting or introsort is an optimised version of quicksort. From the description of the module ~Data.Vector.Algorithms.Intro~:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This module implements various algorithms based on the introsort algorithm, originally described by David R. Musser in the paper /Introspective Sorting and Selection Algorithms/. It is also in widespread practical use, as the standard unstable sort used in the C++ Standard Template Library.

Introsort is at its core a quicksort. The version implemented here has the following optimizations that make it perform better in practice:

- Small segments of the array are left unsorted until a final insertion sort pass. This is faster than recursing all the way down to one-element arrays.
- The pivot for segment [l,u) is chosen as the median of the elements at l, u-1 and (u+l)/2. This yields good behavior on mostly sorted (or reverse-sorted) arrays.
- The algorithm tracks its recursion depth, and if it decides it is taking too long (depth greater than 2 * lg n), it switches to a heap sort to maintain O(n lg n) worst case behavior. (This is what makes the algorithm introsort).
#+END_QUOTE

***** Safe internal mutations

Let's take a look at types of ~U.modify~ and ~Alg.sort~.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
U.modify
  :: U.Unbox a =>
     (forall s. U.MVector s a -> GHC.ST.ST s ())
     -> U.Vector a -> U.Vector a
#+END_SRC

First let's take a look at ~ST~ (state thread). ~ST~ is a monad, it can be described as a restricted ~IO~ monad or a monad for pure mutations. Some functions are more efficient with mutable memory, but global mutable memory is unsafe. This is why we have the ~ST~ monad. With ~ST~ you can use internal mutations, but the whole computation "thread" is not allowed to exchange mutable state with the outside world. Using this monad you can make functions that take in normal Haskell values, then allocate mutable memory, work with it, and return normal Haskell values back.

~ST~ type takes two types as arguments. The first argument is the scope. This is how we can be sure that the computation is pure. If the first argument is an arbitrary type variable then we know that the computation doesn't depend on the initial state, hence it is pure. The second argument is the output state. It is worth mentioning that ~ST~ provides *strict* state threads.

~U.MVector s a~ is a mutable vector of type ~a~ in scope ~s~.

~forall s.~ means that ~s~ can be anything. In this case it's used not to make ~U.modify~ parametrically polymorphic in ~c~, but to make sure that the function passed as an argument is parametrically polymorphic in ~c~. This is done so that the scope of ~ST~ of the result type of the argument function has arbitrary type. In other words, this way we can be sure that the given function returns a pure computation.

So ~U.modify~ takes a function that does a pure computation in ~ST~ and an unboxed vector, and it returns a new vector which is the result of applying the given computation to the given vector.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
Alg.sort
  :: (Ord e, Data.Vector.Generic.Mutable.Base.MVector v e,
      Control.Monad.Primitive.PrimMonad m) =>
     v (Control.Monad.Primitive.PrimState m) e -> m ()
#+END_SRC

~Data.Vector.Generic.Mutable.Base.MVector~ is a class of mutable vectors and ~U.MVector~ is in it.

~PrimMonad~ is a type class for primitive state-transformer monads (~IO~ and ~ST~). ~IO~ and ~ST~ have many operations that are almost the same for both of the monads, which is why ~PrimMonad~ type class was created. This means that ~Alg.sort~ works with both ~ST~ and ~IO~. ~PrimState~ is defined in the type class ~PrimMonad~. It's an associated type giving the type of the state token (~s~ in case of ~ST s~).

~Alg.sort~ takes a mutable vector and sorts it, returning the unit type ~()~ wrapped in a state-transformer monad. So we can pass ~Alg.sort~ as an argument to ~U.modify~.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
U.modify Alg.sort :: (Ord a, U.Unbox a) => U.Vector a -> U.Vector a
#+END_SRC

***** The result of the optimizations

[[./img/optimised_haskell_sort.png]]

As you can see this significantly improved performance. If this still isn't fast enough for you, there are other optimizations that can be done: you can use the foreign function interface to call C functions, reduce the number of different conversions in the script, completely get rid of lists, etc. This shows that Haskell can have decent performance. Depending on what application you're developing you can optimize Haskell to get the performance you need. It's still slower than low-level languages like C, but if you really need certain parts of your code to perform really well then you can use foreign function interface and call C code from Haskell.

**** Abstractions

This example also shows what Haskell's high level abstractions can do. A good example of the language's use of high-level abstractions from the optimized version of the script is how Haskell uses type system to ensure that a state mutating computation is pure using ~ST~ monad. The type system plays a big role in Haskell. Haskell's type system is very strict, but at the same time it uses type variables and type classes, making the language very flexible and allowing you to define the most general versions of functions, variables, etc.

* Reverse Polish server
** Design
<<sec:design_reverse_polish>>

In the script there needs be a data type that represents a simple mathematical expression (in terms of numbers and operators ~+~, ~-~, ~*~, ~/~). For this data type a function that evaluates the expression must be defined. If the function is called on a number then this number gets returned, if the function is called on an expression then the function gets recursively called on the operands and the current operator is applied to the two results.

There must be a function that takes a string and reads the expression in reverse polish notation that is stored in it. The function returns a nullable expression of the expression type. The function uses a stack of expressions. When it sees an operator in the input it takes two expressions from the stack and constructs a new expression with the operator it read as the operator and the two expressions as the operands and puts the new expression in the stack. The function treats the rest of the input as numbers delimited by spaces. After the function finishes going through the entire input string if there is only one element in the stack then it returns it, otherwise it return a null value because the expression is invalid.

These functions are then used to implement the following API endpoints:
- POST: /check - extracts an expression in reverse polish notation in JSON format from the request body and returns a response with a boolean in JSON format. If the given expression is valid then the server responds with ~true~, if the given expression is invalid then the server responds with ~false~.
- POST: /evaluate - extracts an expression in reverse polish notation in JSON format from the request body and returns a response with code 200 and response body containing the result of evaluating the expression if the expression is valid, otherwise returns a response with error code 400 (Bad Request) and error message "invalid".

Parsing expressions in reverse polish notation:

The server:

[[./img/reverse_polish_server.png]]

** Solution
*** Code
**** Haskell
***** Server

To implement the server I created two files: one for the API and one for the implementation of the API. First I defined the API:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds     #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}

module API where

import           Data.Proxy
import           Servant

type API = "check" :> ReqBody '[JSON] String :> Post '[JSON] Bool
      :<|> "evaluate" :> ReqBody '[JSON] String :> Post '[JSON] Float

api :: Proxy API
api = Proxy
#+END_SRC


In the beginning of the script I enable two language extensions. ~DataKinds~ language extensions promotes values to types. The same way as values have types, types have kinds.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
Prelude> :set -XDataKinds -- this is how you enable language extensions in ghci
Prelude> :t 5
5 :: Num p => p
Prelude> :t (+)
(+) :: Num a => a -> a -> a
Prelude> :k Int
Int :: *
Prelude> :k Either
Either :: * -> * -> *
#+END_SRC

~DataKinds~ allows us to use values as types and types as kinds (we still can use them the regular way though).

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
Prelude> :set -XDataKinds
Prelude> data Response = Response
Prelude> :t Response
Response :: Response
Prelude> :k 'Response
'Response :: Response
#+END_SRC

~TypeOperators~ lets us define a type as an operator.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}

data path :> a
data l :<|> r = l :<|> r
#+END_SRC

Notice that ~:>~ doesn't have any type constructors. This means that there are no values of this type, but we can still use this type operator for type-level computations.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
Prelude> :k (:>)
(:>) :: * -> * -> *
Prelude> data l :<|> r = l :<|> r
Prelude> :t (:<|>)
(:<|>) :: l -> r -> l :<|> r
Prelude> :k (:<|>)
(:<|>) :: * -> * -> *
#+END_SRC

These type operators are defined in a library called Servant, which I used to implement the server and the client. Using this library you can define your API in terms of types. Using these type operators and other types provided by Servant we can define the API. Here are the types that I used:
- ~Post~ is a type that represents a post request. It takes a type-level list of content types (response formats, like JSON or XML) and the type of the response (this type must be in the type classes that convert values of this type to formats from the content type type-level list).
- ~JSON~ is a content type. It doesn't have a constructor and it only exists for representing the content type at the type level.
- ~ReqBody~ is a data type that takes a type-level list of content types (request formats that it can accept) and the type of the value that is encoded in one of the content types.

So the type ~API~ represents the API defined in the design section ([[sec:design_reverse_polish]]).
- POST: /check - takes a string in JSON format, returns a boolean in JSON format
- POST: /evaluate - takes a string in JSON format, returns a float in JSON format

Of course this type only defines the endpoints, the actual server logic goes into the implementation. ~API~ is a type and sometimes we need to use the API definition as a value. In Haskell we can't pass types as arguments to functions, which is why we need ~Proxy~. Here is how it's defined:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
{-# LANGUAGE KindSignatures #-}
{-# LANGUAGE PolyKinds #-}

data Proxy (t :: k) = Proxy
#+END_SRC

~KindSignatures~ extension enables explicit kind declarations and ~PolyKinds~ enables kind polymorphism.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
Prelude> data Proxy t = Proxy
Prelude> :k Proxy
Proxy :: * -> *
Prelude> :set -XPolyKinds
Prelude> :set -XKindSignatures 
Prelude> data Proxy (t :: k) = Proxy
Prelude> :k Proxy
Proxy :: k -> *
#+END_SRC

This allows us to pass a value, which is always ~Proxy~, and pass a type by explicitly stating the type of the value that we pass.

Now let's take a look at the implementation of the API.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds         #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators     #-}

            | Number a
            deriving Show

eval :: (Num a, Fractional a) => Expr a -> a
eval (x :+: y)  = eval x + eval y
eval (x :-: y)  = eval x - eval y
eval (x :*: y)  = eval x * eval y
eval (x :/: y)  = eval x / eval y
eval (Number x) = x

parse :: (Read a, Fractional a) => String -> Maybe (Expr a)
parse = flip parseAccum [] . words
  where parseAccum :: (Read a, Num a) => [String] -> [Expr a] -> Maybe (Expr a)
        parseAccum []       [x]        = Just x
        parseAccum ("+":cs) (x1:x2:xs) = parseAccum cs $ x1 :+: x2 : xs
        parseAccum ("-":cs) (x1:x2:xs) = parseAccum cs $ x1 :-: x2 : xs
        parseAccum ("*":cs) (x1:x2:xs) = parseAccum cs $ x1 :*: x2 : xs
        parseAccum ("/":cs) (x1:x2:xs) = parseAccum cs $ x1 :/: x2 : xs
        parseAccum (str:cs) exprs = readMay str >>= parseAccum cs . (: exprs) . Number
        parseAccum _        _          = Nothing

server :: Server API.API
server = maybe (return False) (const $ return True) . parse
    :<|> maybe invalid return . fmap eval . parse
    where invalid = throwError err400 { errBody = "Invalid expression!" }

app :: Application
app = serve API.api server

main :: IO ()
main = run 3000 app
#+END_SRC

First I defined 4 operators which I then used as type constructors. ~infixl~ assigns priority to an operator. I used the same priority for ~:+:~, ~:-:~, ~:*:~, ~:/:~ as Haskell uses by default for ~+~, ~-~, ~*~, ~/~, respectively.

Then I defined a data type (~Expr~) that represents a simple mathematical expression. It's a recursive data type and it's either a number or addition/subtraction/multiplication/division of two expressions. Function ~eval~ evaluates ~Expr~.

~parse~ takes a string with an expression in reverse polish notation and parses it to get an expression of type ~Expr~. It uses several functions for that:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
flip :: (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c -- defined in Prelude

words :: String -> [String] -- defined in Prelude
-- breaks a string up into a list of words, which were delimited by white space

readMay :: Read a => String -> Maybe a -- defined in Safe (library `safe`)
-- parses a string, returns Nothing if fails
#+END_SRC

To implement ~parse~ I wrote a simple local recursive function ~parseAccum~. It takes a list of strings with terms of the given expression in reverse polish notation and a list of expressions of type ~Expr a~, which is used as a stack. If the list of strings is empty and there is only one element in the stack then it means that we successfully parsed the given expression, so ~parseAccum~ just returns the expression from the stack. If the current element of the list of strings is an operator then ~parseAccum~ takes two top elements from the stack, constructs a new expression with the given operator, puts the new expression in the stack, and recursively calls ~parseAccum~ on the rest of the list and the new stack. If the current element of the list is not an operator then it must be a number, so ~parseAccum~ attempts to read a number from the list and if it succeeds then it puts the number into the stack and calls ~parseAccum~ on the rest of the list and the new stack. In any other case it returns Nothing.

~server~ is the implementation of ~API~. ~Server~ is a type family, which is like a type-level function. This way it can figure out what type the implementation of the API should have for any ~API~ type. The API I defined has two endpoints, both of which take data from request body, which is why the actual type is

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
server :: ([Char] -> Handler Bool) :<|> ([Char] -> Handler Float)
#+END_SRC

~Handler~ is a monad from Servant. In this case I don't have any impure computations in the implementation of the server, so I just used ~return~ to get the result that matches the type definition. The implementations for /check and /evaluate are separated by ~:<|>~. The function for /check attempts to parse the given expression and then converts ~Maybe (Expr Double)~ (unspecified arbitrary numbers from ~Fractional~ default to ~Double~) to ~Handler Bool~ using functions ~maybe~, ~const~, and ~return~. The function for /evaluate takes an expression, attempts to parse it, evaluates it and returns in the right type if ~parse~ didn't return ~Nothing~, otherwise it sends a response with HTTP error 400 (Bad request) and message "Invalid expression!".

~app~ converts the API type and the implementation of the API to ~Application~, which is a type defined in ~Network.Wai~ (from library ~wai~ - web application interface). We need to do this because Servant doesn't provide any functions for running the server, it allows you to plug your Servant code into different web servers. WAI provides a common protocol for communication between web applications and web servers. Now that we have a WAI web application we can run it using ~run~ function from ~Network.Wai.Handler.Warp~ (from library ~warp~), which is a web server for WAI applications. ~main~ IO action runs the application on port 3000.

***** Client

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds     #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}

import           Data.Proxy
import           Network.HTTP.Client
import           Safe
import           Servant.API
import           Servant.Client      as SC
import           System.IO

import           API                 (api)

check :: String -> ClientM Bool
evaluate :: String -> ClientM Float

check :<|> evaluate = client api

baseUrl :: BaseUrl
baseUrl = BaseUrl Http "localhost" 3000 ""

data Action = Check | Evaluate deriving (Show, Read)

printResponse :: Show b => Either ServantError b -> IO ()
printResponse = either (putStrLn . ("Error: " ++) . show . SC.responseBody) print

performAction :: String -> Action -> IO ()
performAction expr action =
  let manager = flip ClientEnv baseUrl <$> newManager defaultManagerSettings
  in manager >>= \m -> case action of
                         Check    -> printResponse =<< runClientM (check expr) m
                         Evaluate -> printResponse =<< runClientM (evaluate expr) m

main :: IO ()
main = do expr <- prompt "Expression: "
          action <- prompt "Action (Check or Evaluate): "
          maybe (print "Invalid action!") (performAction expr) $ readMay action
          where prompt str = putStr str >> hFlush stdout >> getLine
#+END_SRC

Using Servant you can generate documentation and client side code from your API type. So I declared functions ~check~ and ~evaluate~ and then used pattern matching to assign the automatically derived implementations from the API type. ~ClientM~ is the monad in which client functions run. 

~API~ type doesn't contain any data about where the web server is hosted, so to run the derived querying functions you need to specify base URL. I defined a variable ~baseUrl~ that stores URI scheme, host, port, and base path.

Then I defined a data type that represents an action (~Check~ or ~Evaluate~) and derived instances of ~Show~ and ~Read~ for it.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
runClientM :: ClientM a -> ClientEnv -> IO (Either ServantError a)
#+END_SRC

As you can see ~runClientM~, the function used for running queries, returns ~IO (Either ServantError a)~. To show responses I wrote a function ~printResponse~.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
either :: (a -> c) -> (b -> c) -> Either a b -> c
SC.responseBody :: ServantError -> Data.ByteString.Lazy.Internal.ByteString
#+END_SRC

~printResponse~ prints the response if no errors occurred and prints ="Error: <error message>"= if the server responded with an error.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data ClientEnv = ClientEnv { Servant.Common.Req.manager :: Manager
                           , Servant.Common.Req.baseUrl :: BaseUrl
                           } -- Defined in ‘Servant.Common.Req’
newManager :: ManagerSettings -> IO Manager
defaultManagerSettings :: ManagerSettings

flip ClientEnv baseUrl <$> newManager defaultManagerSettings :: IO ClientEnv
#+END_SRC

~performAction~ takes an expression and an action. It queries the server to perform the right action and then prints the response using ~printResponse~.

~main~ prompts user for an expression and an action, parses the action using ~readMay~ and performs the action if it is valid, otherwise it prints "Invalid action!". I defined a local function ~prompt~ that takes a string, prints it, and reads a line from the user. ~hFlush~ causes any buffered items to get sent immediately to the operating system. We need to call ~hFlush~ because by default due to Haskell's use of lazy IO the standard output data gets sent to the OS only after we print a new line or the buffer is full.

**** Ruby
***** Server

For the Ruby version of the server I used a popular framework for developing web application called Ruby on Rails. I generated a new rails project and a new controller. Rails uses MVC (model, view, controller) model. Models are used for working with data, views render data, and controllers have the logic of the application.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ rails new ruby --api
$ rails generate controller Main
#+END_SRC

This application is very simple, so all I need is one controller, so I changed ~config/routes.rb~ to tell Rails to use ~MainController~ class for all requests.

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  post '/:action(/:id)', controller: 'main' # route all requests to the main controller
end
#+END_SRC

# #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
#   exprs.unshift Expr.new '+', exprs.shift, exprs.shift
# when '-'
#   epxrs.unshift Expr.new '-', exprs.shift, epxrs.shift
# when '*'
#   exprs.unshift Expr.new '*', epxrs.shift, exprs.shift
# when '/'
#   epxrs.unshift Expr.new '/', exprs.shift, exprs.shift

# # what's the problem with this code???
# #+END_SRC

Then I wrote ~MainController~.

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
# class that handles HTTP requests
class MainController < ApplicationController
  # /check
  def check
    # .nil? returns true if the object is nil
    # parse the expression from the request and return boolean

    render json: !parse(JSON.parse(request.body.read)).nil?
  end

  # /evaluate
  def evaluate
    # check if the expression is valid
    if (expr = parse(JSON.parse(request.body.read))).nil?
      # if it's invalid respond with an error
      render body: 'Invalid expression!', status: 400
    else
      # evaluate the expression and return the result in JSON
      render json: eval_expr(expr)
    end
  end

  # everything below is private
  private

  # class that represents a simple mathematical expression
  class Expr
    # getters and setters for a binary operator and two operands
    attr_accessor :operator, :operand1, :operand2

    def initialize(operator, operand1, operand2)
      self.operator = operator
      self.operand1 = operand1
      self.operand2 = operand2
    end
  end

  # function for evaluating expressions
  def eval_expr(expr)
    # return nil if the given expression is nil
    nil if expr.nil?

    case expr
    when Expr # when the expression is an instance of Expr
      # evaluate the operands and apply the operator to the results
      case expr.operator
      when '+'
        eval_expr(expr.operand1) + eval_expr(expr.operand2)
      when '-'
        eval_expr(expr.operand1) - eval_expr(expr.operand2)
      when '*'
        eval_expr(expr.operand1) * eval_expr(expr.operand2)
      when '/'
        eval_expr(expr.operand1) / eval_expr(expr.operand2)
      end
    else
      # when the expression is not an instance of Expr it should be a number
      # return the number
      expr
    end
  end

  # function for parsing expressions
  def parse(str)
    exprs = []  # array of expressions used as a stack

        case d
        when '+'
          exprs.unshift Expr.new '+', exprs.shift, exprs.shift
        when '-'

** Evaluation
**** Safety

In this example I defined an API using types. This approach ensures that the implementation of the server corresponds to the API definition. For example, we can be absolutely sure that /check takes a string and returns a boolean. In the ruby version of the server we don't have that safety. We can accidentally return the result in a wrong format or return nothing at all. Also, with this approach you only use the parameters of the request that you specified in the API type. For example if all you need from a request is the body then you define the type with ~ReqBody~ and get the contents of the request body. If the request data that you can access is restricted by the type then there are less mistakes you can possibly make when you implement the API. When you are implementing your API using Servant you only think about the logic of your code, things like encoding and decoding data are done automatically through type classes. This also reduces the number of possible bugs.

**** Expressiveness

Just by looking at the number of lines of code that I wrote we can see how Haskell is more expressive.

|----------+---------------------------------|
| Language | Lines of code (client + server) |
|----------+---------------------------------|
| Haskell  |                             108 |
| Ruby     |                             179 |
|----------+---------------------------------|

Keep in mind that this is all the Haskell code, but I didn't include 380 lines of ruby code in different configuration files generated by the framework. The reason I didn't include them is that Ruby on Rails framework is an overkill for the problem that I was solving. The Haskell version of the code not only uses less amount of code, but it is also almost exactly matches the algorithms' descriptions in English in [[sec:design_reverse_polish]]. For example, let's take a look at the ~parse~ function.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
parse :: (Read a, Fractional a) => String -> Maybe (Expr a)
parse = flip parseAccum [] . words
  where parseAccum :: (Read a, Num a) => [String] -> [Expr a] -> Maybe (Expr a)
        parseAccum []       [x]        = Just x
        -- "if there is one element in the stack then return it"

        parseAccum ("+":cs) (x1:x2:xs) = parseAccum cs $ x1 :+: x2 : xs
        parseAccum ("-":cs) (x1:x2:xs) = parseAccum cs $ x1 :-: x2 : xs
        parseAccum ("*":cs) (x1:x2:xs) = parseAccum cs $ x1 :*: x2 : xs
        parseAccum ("/":cs) (x1:x2:xs) = parseAccum cs $ x1 :/: x2 : xs
        -- "when it sees an operator in the input it takes two expressions
        -- from the stack and constructs a new expression with the operator
        -- it read as the operator and the two expressions as the operands
        -- and puts the new expression in the stack"

        parseAccum (str:cs) exprs = readMay str >>= parseAccum cs . (: exprs) . Number
        -- the function treats the rest of the input as numbers

        parseAccum _        _          = Nothing
        -- the expression is invalid
#+END_SRC

As I mentioned in the evaluation of safety the implementation of the API contains only the logic of the application. This feature not only makes the code safer, but also makes it more expressive. This shows that Haskell is very expressive.

**** High level abstractions

Defining an API in terms of types is a great example of Haskell's high level abstractions. In most languages even if you have a type system you can't do anything like this. First of all you can't define readable type-level grammar. Also even if you somehow manage to define types that can be used for constructing a type that represents an arbitrary REST API, the constructed type will be useless because the majority of languages don't support type-level functions. So you won't be able to type check the implementation of your API.

The point I made about only describing logic in the implementation of the server is also relevant to this discussion. The way Servant encodes and decodes data to the right formats just by looking at the type definition of your API is also a great example of using abstractions in Haskell. But you can go even further and define an API type using type variables and then implement it once for an arbitrary type variable that is constraint by type classes that are required for encoding, decoding, etc. This can be useful if, for example, you need the same CRUD (create, read, update delete) API for several entities. All these features of the type system give Haskell support for all kinds of different abstractions.

**** Modularity

The fact that you can use types to define APIs is good for modularity. You can define parts of your API and then compose them. Also you can use the approach I mentioned in the previous section.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
-- ...
type Create a = ReqBody '[JSON] a :> Post '[JSON] a

type Read a = Get '[JSON, PlainText] a

data User = -- ...

type UserAPI = Create User :<|> Read User

userServer :: Server UserAPI
userServer = -- ...

data Mail = -- ...

type MailsAPI = Create Mail :<|> Read Mail

mailServer :: Server MailAPI
mailServer = -- ...

type API = "users" :> UserAPI
      :<|> "mails" :> MailAPI

server :: Server API
server = userServer :<|> mailServer
#+END_SRC

As you can see defining APIs using types is good for modularity. Haskell itself is very modular. And its high level abstractions allow developers to use standard (more or less) tools when they develop libraries. So, for example, grammar for defining APIs can be embedded directly into the language. This means that you can write modular code and then easily reuse it. You can also extend the grammar by providing the required type class instances for your types and type combinators. This shows that Haskell has good modularity.

**** Performance

Let's query the /evaluate endpoint of both of the servers 1000 times with the same expression ~15 7 1 1 + - / 3 * 2 1 1 + + -~ and see how much time it will take for each of the servers. To do this I changed the end of the client script. I added ~repeatAction~ function that takes an integer ~n~ and a monadic action, and runs the action ~n~ times.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
repeatAction :: Monad m => Integer -> m () -> m ()
repeatAction n a = foldr (const (>> a)) (return ()) [1..n]

performAction :: String -> Action -> IO ()
performAction expr action =
  let manager = flip ClientEnv baseUrl <$> newManager defaultManagerSettings
  in manager >>= \m -> case action of
                         Check    -> printResponse =<< runClientM (check expr) m
                         Evaluate -> repeatAction 1000 $ printResponse =<< runClientM (evaluate expr) m

main :: IO ()
main = performAction "15 7 1 1 + - / 3 * 2 1 1 + + -" Evaluate
#+END_SRC

Here are the results of the benchmark that show that the Haskell version of the server worked more than 3 times faster than the Ruby version.

* Conclusion
** Safety

Haskell allows you to encode logic in types. The benefits of this approach is that at compile time your code is checked and it must follow the types, so if your logic is encoded in types then the compiler checks that your code follows your logic. I showed this with the web server example, there I encoded the API in types. Then when I implemented the API the compiler checked that the code implements the specified API.

Using Haskell you can avoid almost all run-time errors. For example, if you have a function that can fail then you encode that fail in types by wrapping the result in ~Maybe~, ~Either a~ or another monad. This way when you actually use the function the compiler will force you to check that the function didn't fail, otherwise the code won't type check.

Immutability also makes a big role in making Haskell a very safe language. A lot of the errors in imperative languages are caused by state change. In most languages you can change a global variable in one function without realizing that this will break another function.

If you declare the type of your function or variable before the value then the number of possible ways in which you can write this variable or function is significantly reduced. There are few ways of writing the right code and many ways of writing incorrect code, in most languages the number of ways to write incorrect code is infinite. Haskell reduces the number of ways in which you can write your code, making it harder to write code that compiles, but doesn't work as it should.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data Bool = True | False

not :: Bool -> Bool
#+END_SRC

There are four ways of defining the function ~not~ (2 possible inputs and 2 possible outputs for each of them). In languages like Ruby there are infinitely many ways of defining a function like this, just because the language doesn't have a type system and it uses impure functions. In languages like C# there are still infinitely many ways of defining ~not~. The type system reduces the number of possible inputs and outputs, but you still can do any impure computations inside the function. You can choose to write some code that is not directly related to the function ~not~ and crash the application, for example by just dividing by zero. In Haskell to cause a problem this way you would need to put the division somewhere in the code and also force Haskell to evaluate the division, because Haskell won't evaluate the expression with division by zero as the result of the function doesn't depend on it. This is another example of how in Haskell it's harder to write incorrect code. Another example is ~maybe~ function.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
maybe :: b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b
#+END_SRC

There are only two ways of defining this function (return the first argument or do the right thing). Because the function's type uses arbitrary type variables you can't just construct a new value of type ~b~ or do modify somehow the first two arguments. And sometimes type declaration uniquely defines what the function does. Below there are three functions that you can't implement incorrectly.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
id :: a -> a
const :: a -> b -> a
flip :: (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c
#+END_SRC

All these examples show how Haskell's type system and immutability make your code safer.

** Expressiveness

Haskell types not only make code safer, but they also make it more readable. Type signature significantly reduces the number of possible implementations of the function, so if you know the name and the type of a function then more often than not you can tell what the function does without looking at the implementation. This helps a lot when you are working in a team and you want to use a function written by another person. It also makes it easier to use libraries. By defining types using ~newtype~ and ~type~ you can make it even easier to understand what functions do without using any more data at run time.

As you saw in the examples, Haskell usually requires less code to solve a problem. The reason for this is the minimalist syntax and features like partial application, pattern matching, custom operators, etc. Also, in both cases the code was close to the description of the problem in English. This shows that Haskell is a very expressive language.
